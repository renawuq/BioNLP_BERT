Objectives: The cost-effectiveness of FF/UMEC/VI vs FF/VI was assessed, from a Canadian public payer perspective. Methods: A validated linked risk equation model (Briggs, Med Decis Making 37;4 2017), which predicts COPD disease progression, associated healthcare costs and health outcomes, was populated with baseline characteristics, efficacy and medication use from IMPACT. Canadian healthcare resource unit costs and drug costs were applied, with future costs and health outcomes discounted at 1.5% annually. Analysis was probabilistic, with a lifetime horizon and outputs including exacerbation rates, costs (2017 CAD), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY. Results: Compared with FF/VI, FF/UMEC/VI treatment resulted in fewer moderate and severe exacerbations (10.52 and 3.38 vs 11.13 and 3.48), mean (95% CI) incremental costs and QALYs of $2,598 ($2,010, $3,268) and 0.13 (0.09, 0.18), and an ICER of $19,649 per QALY ($15,406, $26,454). The probability of FF/UMEC/VI being cost-effective vs FF/VI was 100% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. Results were most sensitive to time horizon, and efficacy of treatment post-discontinuation. Conclusions: FF/UMEC/VI was predicted to improve health outcomes and to be a cost-effective option for treatment of moderate/severe COPD compared with FF/VI, in Canada.", "label": 0}

Objectives The purpose of this study is to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients referred to a pediatric emergency department (ED) for unintentional poisoning exposures by a poison control center (PCC) compared with patients/caregivers who self-refer. Methods The electronic data warehouse at a pediatric hospital was queried from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015, for unintentional poisoning-related ED visits and subsequent inpatient admissions. Eligible patients aged 18 years and younger were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for pharmaceuticals, non-pharmaceuticalchemicals, fumes/vapors, foreign bodies, adverse food reactions, food poisoning, and bites/stings. Referral classification (PCC referral vs self-refer) was determined by PCC and hospital medical records. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patient demographics and ED visits by referral classification and age group. Simple and multiple logistic regression models examined the individual and combined impact of demographic and clinical characteristics on self-referral. Results Of the 705 patients identified, 84.4% presented as caregiver/self-referred compared with PCC-referred. As compared with those who self-referred, a higher percentage of patients who contacted the PCC before ED presentation were white (93.9% [89.4\u201398.2%] vs 83.8% [80.7\u201386.7%]) and had commercial insurance (62.7% [51.5\u201369.5%] vs 53.0% [48.9\u201357.0%]). Pharmaceutical (71.9%) and chemical (14.0%) exposures were the most common exposure types for PCC-referred patients whereas foreign bodies (54.3%) were the most common for self-referred patients. The largest predictors of self-referral were age, insurance, and exposure type. Conclusions Among patients presenting at 1 pediatric ED, disparities with PCC utilization exist among age groups, racial identification, and poison exposure type. Educational outreach interventions are needed to ensure optimal use of the PCC services by patients, caregivers, and health care professionals.", "label": 0}

The most recent study regarding the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in mainland China was a meta-analysis published in 2011, and the subjects from the included studies were mostly enrolled before 2008, thus making it now obsolete. Current data on the national prevalence of DR-TB is needed. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the status of DR-TB epidemic in mainland China. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies regarding the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in mainland China was performed. Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane central database, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database were searched for studies relevant to drug-resistant tuberculosis that were published between January 1, 2012 and May 18, 2015. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (V2.2, Biostat) software was used to analyse the data. Results A total of fifty-nine articles, published from 2012 to 2015, were included in our review. The result of this meta-analysis demonstrated that among new cases, the rate of resistance to any drug was 20.1% (18.0%\u201322.3%; n/N = 7203/34314) and among retreatment cases, the rate was 49.8% (46.0%\u201353.6%; n/N = 4155/8291). Multi-drug resistance among new and retreatment cases was 4.8% (4.0%\u20135.7%; n/N = 2300/42946) and 26.3% (23.1%\u201329.7%; n/N = 3125/11589) respectively. The results were significantly heterogeneous (p<0.001, I2 tests). Resistance to isoniazid was the most common resistance observed, and HRSE (H: isoniazid; R: rifampicin; S: streptomycin; E: ethambutol) was the most common form for MDR among both new and retreatment cases. Different drug resistance patterns were found by subgroup analysis according to geographic areas, subject enrolment time, and methods of drug susceptibility test (DST). Conclusions The prevalence of resistance to any drug evidently dropped for both new and retreatment cases, and multi-drug resistance declined among new cases but became more prevalent among retreatment cases compared to the data before 2008. Therefore, drug-resistant tuberculosis, particularly multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis among retreatment TB cases is a public health issue in China that requires a constant attention in order to prevent increase in MDR-TB cases.", "label": 0}

This study highlights the role of comparing different metal ions on synthetic nanoapatite in regulating the antibacterial properties and toxicity. The comparisons between infrared spectra and between diffractograms have confirmed that metal ions do not affect the formation of HA phases. The results show that after doped Cu2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ ions replace Ca2+, the ionic radius is almost the same, but significantly smaller than that of the original Ca2+ ions, and the substitution effect causes the lattice distance to change, resulting in crystal structure distortion and reducing crystallinity. The reduction in the length of the nanopatites after the incorporation of Cu2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ ions confirmed that the metal ions were mainly substituted during the growth of the rod-shape nanoapatite Ca2+ distributed along the longitudinal site. The antibacterial results show that nanoapatite containing Cu2+ (0.1%), Mg2+ (3%), and Zn2+ (5\u20137%) has obvious and higher antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus within 2 days. The antibacterial effect against the gram-negative bacillus Escherichia coli is not as pronounced as against Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial effect of Cu2+ substituted Ca2+ with an atomic ratio of 0.1~1.0% is even better than that of Mg2+- and Zn2+- doped with 1~7% groups. In terms of cytotoxicity, nanoapatites with Cu2+ (~0.2%) exhibit cytotoxicity, whereas Mg2+- (1\u20135%) and Zn2+- (~1%) doped nanoapatites are biocompatible at low concentrations but become cytotoxic as ionic concentration increases. The results show that the hydrothermally synthesized nanoapatite combined with Cu2+ (0.2%), Mg2+ (3%), and Zn2+ (3%) exhibits low toxicity and high antibacterial activity, which provides a good prospect for bypassing antibiotics for future biomedical applications.", "label": 0}

In a recent paper, Lin et al. (2017) conduct \u201cEntity linking\" to supplement established document classification methods to predict a Tweet\u2019s five moral labels. These moral labels, which are theoretically derived from Moral Foundations Theory (see Graham et al., 2013, for a synopsis), are a set of binary labels that apply at the document level. Each label, when active, signifies that a given \u201cmoral concern\" is used by the writer of the particular text. There are five labels, corresponding to the five moral foundations: fairness, care, authority, loyalty, and purity. In Lin et al. (2017), the authors link entities in Tweets and link them to an external Knowledge Base (Wikipedia) and append the text of the linked entities\u2019 abstracts to the document. They achieve superior performance using this method, in comparison to purely text-based methods. In my project, I propose to improve this classification in two ways: (1) In terms of classification performance; (2) In terms of explainability. In this field, a key element of any predictive system is the ability to provide \u201creasoning\" for each prediction, or a \u201ctrail of evidence\" which influences the learner\u2019s decision. Such information can facilitate collaboration between NLP researchers and domain experts, allowing the latter to design schema for future IE given the evidence provided to them in text classification. The method I will be using for classification is an attention-based LSTM (e.g. Wang et al., 2016). To form a coherent set of features which offers explainability in the form of entities (and their types) rather than just words, I propose to conduct distantly-supervised entity recognition and typing in the style of Ren et al. (2015). This will supplement traditional features in text classification (word and character n-grams, word embeddings, syntactic feature mining). In terms of the knowledge bases I will use to conduct distant supervision of the entity recognition and typing, I will use both established (i.e. Wikipedia) KB as well as less traditional, more specialized schema. This latter category of KB include actorand eventontologies in the political science community, notably CAMEO (Schrodt et al., 2008). Additionally, I have been working on developing a schema for structuring \u201cpolitical objects\", including persons, groups, events, and concepts, which will be applied at later stages of the project, time allowing. The data I am using for this project is a set of roughly 30,000 annotated Tweets. Each Tweet has multiple annotations for each of the 5 moral foundations.

ABSTRACT Physical exercise as potential reducer of cardiotoxicity induced by antineoplastic treatments: systematic review Introduction: Currently the oncological treatment has reached a new level of high reliability in diagnosis and high-quality treatment, however the comorbidities associated with the treatment have become a problem for the survivors. Among these comorbidities, cardiotoxicity is one of the most dangerous. Exercise has proven an effective tool in the struggle against the comorbidities and the deleterious effects of the anticancer treatment. Objective: This review aimed to conduct a survey in the literature about possible beneficial effects of physical exercise in reducing the deleterious effects of cardiotoxicity. Methods: The databases searched were PubMed/Medline, Scielo and PEDro. The selected keywords were \"exercise\", \"cardiotoxicity\", \"neoplasm\" and the uncontrolled keyword \"cancer\" and their respective translations to Portuguese. Results: Four articles were selected to be part of this review published between the years of 2007 and 2013. All studies were performed in the population with breast cancer; among the findings the authors observed positive effects on VO2peak, resting heart rate, tumor blood perfusion, systolic blood pressure. Discussion: The results are in line with other published systematic reviews that studied the effects of exercise on cardiovascular parameters after neoplasic treatment. Studies in animal models also show that exercise can be an effective tool to mitigate deleterious effects of cardiotoxicity. Conclusion: It is possible to identify that physical exercise can be presented as a potential benefactor against the harmful effects of cardiotoxicity, Exercise is also viable and secure when prescribed by health professionals.", "label": 0}

Emotional paraphrasing, which changes the emotion embodied in a piece of text while preserving its meaning, has many potential applications, e.g., moderating online dialogues and preventing cyberbullying. We introduce a new task of fine-grained emotional paraphrasing along emotion gradients, that is, altering the emotional intensities of the paraphrases in fine grain following smooth variations in affective dimensions while preserving the meanings of the originals. We propose a framework for addressing this task by fine-tuning text-to-text Transformers through multi-task training. We enhance several widely used paraphrasing corpus by annotating the input and target texts with their fine-grained emotion labels. With these labels, fine-tuning text-to-text Transformers on these corpus entails multi-task training. Evaluations of the fine-tuned Transformers on separate test sets show that including fine-grained emotion labels in the paraphrase task significantly improve the chance of obtaining high-quality paraphrases of the desired emotions, i.e., more than doubling the number of exact matches of desired emotions while achieving consistently better scores in paraphrase metrics such as BLEU, ROGUE, and METEOR.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain-recognizing arbitrary single characters from Street View images. Similar problems, such as recognizing arbitrary multi-digits in street view images [Goodfellow, et al., 2013] and Recognizing Text in Google Street View Image [Lintern, et all., 2008], were well-investigated with decent solutions including localization, segmentation, image feature generation as well as applying machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a unified approach that integrates both localization and segmentation via the use of convolutional neural networks that operates directly on the image pixels. We have experimented with two main types of convolutional neural networks-a thin deep network like Google Network proposed in ILSVRC-2012 competition and a flat shallow network like Alex Network proposed in ILSVRC-2012 competition. We find that the performance of neural network solution works much better than the traditional approach of classification based on image features, while the performance of this approach increases little with the depth of the convolutional network. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available Chars74K dataset and achieve over 84% accuracy in recognizing individual characters in the street view images.

Gas vesicles increase the buoyancy of cells and enable them to migrate vertically in the water body to regions with optimal conditions. Their synthesis depends on environmental factors, such as light, oxygen supply, temperature and salt concentration. Fourteen gas vesicle protein (gvp) genes are involved in their formation, and regulation of gvp gene expression occurs at the level of transcription, including the two regulatory proteins, GvpD and GvpE, but also at the level of translation. The gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, GvpA and GvpC, and seven additional accessory proteins are also involved.

Scotch Bonnet in Florida.", "abstract": "Scotch bonnet (Capsicum chinense) is a tropical hot pepper variety that is grown in South America, the Caribbean Islands, and in Florida, and is an important cash crop. In Florida, scotch bonnet is grown on ~100 acres annually. Virus-like leaf symptoms including mosaic and yellow mottling were observed on scotch bonnet plants in a field at Quincy, FL, with a disease incidence of ~5%. Two symptomatic and one non-symptomatic plant sample were collected from this field for identification of the causal agent associated with the symptoms. Viral inclusion assays (2) of the epidermal tissues of the symptomatic scotch bonnet samples using Azure A stain indicated the presence of spherical aggregates of crystalline inclusion bodies. Testing of the symptomatic samples using lateral flow immunoassays (Immunostrips, Agdia, Elkhart, IN) specific to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus Y (PVY), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), showed a positive reaction only to CMV. The sap from an infected leaf sample ground in 0.01 M Sorensons phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used to mechanically inoculate one healthy scotch bonnet plant (tested negative for CMV with Immunostrip) at the 2- to 3-leaf stage. The inoculated plant developed mild mosaic and mottling symptoms 12 to 14 days post inoculation. The presence of CMV in the mechanically inoculated plant was further verified using CMV Immunostrips. Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from the previously collected two symptomatic and one non-symptomatic scotch bonnet samples. The samples were subjected to reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR assays using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and using multiplex RT-PCR primer sets (1). The primers were designed to differentiate the CMV subgroup I and II, targeting the partial coat protein gene and the 3'UTR. The RT-PCR assays using the multiplex primers produced an amplicon of 590 bp, with the CMV subgroup I primers. The RT-PCR product was only amplified from the symptomatic leaf samples. The obtained amplicons were gel eluted, and directly sequenced bi-directionally (GenBank Accession Nos. KF805389 and KF805390). BLAST analysis of these sequences showed 97 to 98% nucleotide identities with the CMV isolates in the NCBI database. The isolates collected in Florida exhibited highest identity (98%) with the CMV isolate from tomato (DQ302718). These results revealed the association of CMV subgroup I with symptomatic scotch bonnet leaf samples.

This enables transfer learning of semantics for a variety of natural language processing tasks.Word embeddings are typically trained on large public corpora such as Wikipedia or Twitter. We demonstrate that an attacker who can modify the corpus on which the embedding is trained can control the \"meaning\" of new and existing words by changing their locations in the embedding space. We develop an explicit expression over corpus features that serves as a proxy for distance between words and establish a causative relationship between its values and embedding distances. We then show how to use this relationship for two adversarial objectives: (1) make a word a top-ranked neighbor of another word, and (2) move a word from one semantic cluster to another.An attack on the embedding can affect diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating for the first time the power of data poisoning in transfer learning scenarios. We use this attack to manipulate query expansion in information retrieval systems such as resume search, make certain names more or less visible to named entity recognition models, and cause new words to be translated to a particular target word regardless of the language. Finally, we show how the attacker can generate linguistically likely corpus modifications, thus fooling defenses that attempt to filter implausible sentences from the corpus using a language model.", "label": 0}

While the existing methods consider uniformly sampled single-or multi-scale patches from the neighborhood of each voxel, this approach might be sub-optimal as it captures and processes unnecessary details far away from the center of the patch. We instead propose to train CNNs with non-uniformly sampled patches that allow a wider extent for the sampled patches. This results in more captured contextual information, which is in particular of interest for biomedical image analysis, where the anatomical location of imaging features are often crucial. We evaluate and compare this strategy for white matter hyperintensity segmentation on a test set of 46 MRI scans.

Parallel to the important work of identifying misinformation on digital platforms is understanding why such material proliferates. One approach to answering this question is to attempt to understand the values that are being targeted by misinformation as a means of interpreting the underlying social bonds that are at stake. This study examines the kinds of social bonds that are communed around and contested in a corpus of YouTube video comments about the viral internet hoax \u2018The Momo Challenge\u2019. A social semiotic approach to \u2018ambient affiliation\u2019 (Zappavigna, 2011) is used to investigate how these bonds are negotiated in this digital discourse. This approach involves establishing the types of personae (for instance Moralisers, Myth Spreaders and Connoisseurs) who were negotiating meaning in the comments on the basis of the values that they recurrently shared, deferred or disputed. The analysis suggests that, in addition to concern over whether Momo was real and dangerous, there was a deeper moral panic about parenting in the digital age and the legitimacy of institutions such as schools and media as brokers of knowledge.", "label": 0}

This is the first workshop on Multimedia Information Indexing and Retrieval for Healthcare and is intended to establish a platform for the continued discussion of key research issues in multimedia for healthcare, remote monitoring and treatment. Multimodal monitoring for health can take place at home, but should be discreet, unobtrusive and personalized. Theoretical, i.e. research-oriented and practical, application-specific issues related to the extraction of lifestyle, behavior and health information from multimodal data will be examined. The setup of smart homes has become of great interest lately, as the latter need to ensure accurate, reliable, discreet and cost-efficient measurements, involving, among others, privacy protection and appropriate sensor placement. Marketing of multimodal remote monitoring options also needs to be examined carefully, as independent living at home, smart homes and remote care are forecast to gain importance in years to come. Multimedia Indexing and Retrieval research is now being oriented towards this application domain of primarily importance for the society. Workshop papers and presentations will focus on the analysis of multimodal data to obtain information pertinent to healthcare problems and also examine remote monitoring solutions. Personalization, unobtrusiveness, accuracy of analysis results, data storage, retrieval, transmission, marketability and privacy concerns are among the many topics that will be discussed. \n \nThe workshop will provide a forum for researchers from all over the world to share information on their latest investigations on multimedia information retrieval and indexing with healthcare applications. MIIRH is held as a one day workshop with presentations from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm with breaks and a 1-hour lunch period. \n \nThe call for papers attracted many submissions from Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas. The program committee accepted 10 papers that cover a variety of topics, including: recognition of daily living activities, analysis of therapy exercises, fall detection, context aware recommendation, experience sharing, and medical image retrieval. In addition to paper presentations, posters and demos, MIIRH will feature an invited keynote talk by Prof. Linda Shapiro on \"Image Analysis for Biomedical and Healthcare Applications\" as well as an invited talk by Prof. Jean-Francois Dartigues on \"Dementia and Dependency: a Major Challenge for the 21st century\". We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for healthcarerelated multimedia indexing and retrieval researchers and developers.", "label": 1}

Drug carriers offer significant advantages over the conventional drug delivery systems in terms of high stability, high specificity, high drug loading capacity, controlled release of drug and ability to deliver both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. As a result of their unique behaviors, drug carriers have a wide range of biomedical and industrial applications. Nanospheres are associated with a lot of benefits such as ease of administration to target sites, reduction in toxicity level and ease of passage via the capillary vessels. Hydrogel nanoparticles are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, as bioresponsive hydrogels in drug delivery system and as a carrier in controlled drug delivery system.\u00a0 Carbon nanotubes have a large surface area which has the ability to adsorb or conjugate with a wide variety of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. They are useful in the areas of gene delivery, tissue regeneration and biosensor diagnosis. Liposomes are known to target a drug to a specific site. They entrap drugs which are released for subsequent absorption. They are used to achieve active targeting, increase efficacy and therapeutic index of drugs. Niosomes improve the solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. They protect drugs from biological environment, increase the stability of entrapped drugs and they can easily reach the site of action. Aquasomes are nanoparticulate carriers that can be characterized for structural analysis. They preserve conformational integrity and biochemical stability of drugs. Ethosomes are noninvasive delivery carriers that enable drugs to reach the deep skin layers and the systemic circulation.\u00a0 They contain phospholipids which could be in form of phosphatidyl choline (PC), hydrogenated PC, phosphatidic acid (PA), Phosphatidyl serine (PS) and phosphatidyl inositol (PI). Ethosomes are known to increase skin permeation of drugs, improve biological activity and pharmacodynamics profile of drugs. This review aims to emphasize the importance of drug carriers in drug delivery system, and applications of drug carriers in various areas of research, technology and treatment.\n\u00a0", "label": 0}

Main goal of this grid computing paradigm is to share local but limited resources with others to solve very complex problems [Foster 2003]. Especially, semantics and knowledge are playing an important role of building an efficient grid platform to share information and knowledge with each other [de Roure et al. 2005]. A variety of domains, e.g., business [Zhen and Jiang 2008, Jung 2008], chemistry [Taylor et al. 2006], information retrieval [Jung 2007], and biomedical areas [Tsiknakis et al. 2008], have been attempting to employ this semantic grid platform. However, there are several hurdles that they have to overcome in common, e.g., semantic heterogeneity (e.g., inconsistency and conflict) between information sources on a grid. In order to efficiently deal with the hurdles and implement the semantic grid platform, there have been representative approaches, e.g., web services (S-OGSA [Corcho et al. 2006]), metadata, ontologies and reasoning. More particularly, collective intelligence is the latest buzzword to take into account how to find any opportunities to link individual intelligence as well as how to apply the collective intelligence to various problems. In this issue, we are focusing on the semantic and knowledge grid platforms (as well as distributed platforms) for building and exploiting collective intelligence.

Commentary on Sestini (2009) 'Epistemology and ethics of evidence-based medicine'.", "abstract": "In \u2018Epistemology and ethics of evidence-based medicine: Putting goal-setting in the right place\u2019, Piersante Sestini argues that evidence-based medicine (EBM) is highly consistent with Karl Popper\u2019s philosophy of science, which famously demarcated science by the falsifiability criterion and highlighted for generations of scientists the inherent fallibility of scientific claims. In this commentary, I will demonstrate, contra Sestini, that Popper and EBM share only superficial similarity. Furthermore, Sestini\u2019s focus on the centrality that formulating the clinical question plays in evidence-based practice instead highlights EBM\u2019s compatibility with the Kuhnian picture of \u2018normal science\u2019. Despite Sestini\u2019s claim to find high compatibility between EBM and Popper\u2019s objective theory of conjectural knowledge [1], he illustrates only a thin allegiance between the two. Sestini finds Popperian influence in the EBM criterion that clinicians begin by \u2018formulating an answerable question\u2019. While an unanswerable question would certainly fall outside of the purview of Popperian science, it was the untestable hypothesis that interested Popper in his demarcation of science from pseudoscience. A hypothesis is considered scientific if it is testable, that is, falsifiable by way of a possible observational event that is incompatible with theoretical prediction [2]. All other theories, even those making empirical claims, are pseudo-science. For example, broad ideological theories, like Marx\u2019s theory of history and Freud\u2019s theory of psychoanalysis, make empirical claims about the world and have remarkable explanatory power (according to Marxists and Freudians), yet cannot be disconfirmed by singular observational events. The grandness of their claims, and constant supply of confirming evidence \u2013 \u2018a Marxist could not open a newspaper without finding on every page confirming evidence for his interpretation of history; not only in the news, but also in its presentation \u2013 which revealed the class bias of the paper \u2013 and especially of course in what the paper did not say\u2019 ([2], p. 46) \u2013 seemed to permit such discretion ([2], pp. 43\u201377). Unlike the logical positivists\u2019 claim that nonscience is non-sense, Popper allowed such metaphysical speculation to be meaningful and informative. They were not, however, scientific claims [3]. Sestini also links the \u2018evidence-based\u2019 criterion \u2013 the evidence determines the answer to clinical problems \u2013 to Popper\u2019s demarcation of science: External clinical evidence both invalidates previously accepted diagnostic tests and treatments and replaces them with new ones that are more powerful, more accurate, more efficacious, and safer, which is as close as it could be to Popper\u2019s criterion of demarcation based on falsifiability [4]. Yet an accurate reading of Popper reveals that theories can only be falsified and not confirmed by any inductive evidence. The \u2018replacement\u2019 of old invalidated theories with new ones is merely conjectural. In a dramatic break from the common picture of science as an inductive process, Popper proposed that science progresses through a series of conjectures and refutations [2]. Scientists hold onto their conjectures until damning evidence falsifies them in a methodology of \u2018trial and the examination of error\u2019 ([1], p. 18). Once falsified, the conjecture is abandoned, a new one is proposed, and the effort at falsification is repeated. The growth of scientific knowledge, for Popper, results from an enlarging body of falsified knowledge claims. While Popper\u2019s account of science avoids the vexing \u2018problem of induction\u2019 for empiricism [5,6], critics have frequently argued that a theory of scientific reasoning devoid of theory confirmation is unworkable for actual scientific practice [7]. What is a Popperian biomedical researcher or doctor supposed to do when faced with competing solutions to a clinical problem \u2013 that is, two unfalsified claims? Popper is quite clear that we have no logical grounds for selecting one over the other. It is surprising that Popper is such a hero to scientists given how irrational he made theory choice. Yet Sestini\u2019s comment is also linked to the democratic tenor of the evidence-based programme. EBM was lauded in the early literature as an iconoclastic practice [8]. Much like Popper\u2019s critical science, evidence-based practitioners do not resist disconfirming evidence nor hold onto their theories dogmatically. Popper took this critical attitude even further by encouraging scientists to pursue actively disconfirming observational evidence in order to increase the robustness of their theories. This picture of the proper scientific attitude is hugely attractive. The Popperian scientist\u2019s character traits include creativity, critical thinking and openmindedness [2]. EBM, however, does not demand the critical scientist that Popper envisioned. EBM offers a detailed systematic approach to clinical problem solving that demands rule-following and compliance (albeit those rules may be reasonable!) rather than open-ended inquiry. A re-examination of Sestini\u2019s area of interest, the formulation of the clinical question in evidence-based practice, demonstrates this to be the case.", "label": 0}

Sometimes terms such as \u2018phenomenal consciousness\u2019 and even \u2018qualia\u2019 are also used, but it is natural to speak of \u2018conscious experience\u2019 or simply \u2018experience\u2019. These terms imply here that the process being studied (vision, pain, memory, imagination, etc.) appears as relevant and manifest for a \u2018self\u2019 or \u2018subject\u2019 that can provide an account; they have a \u2018subjective\u2019 side. In contrast, third-person descriptions concern the descriptive experiences associated with the study of other natural phenomena. Although there are always human agents in science who provide and produce descriptions, the contents of such descriptions (i.e. of biochemical reactions, black holes or synaptic voltages) are not clearly or immediately linked to the human agents who come up with them. Their defining characteristics refer to properties of world events without a direct manifestation in the experiential-mental sphere; they can only be linked to this sphere indirectly (via the actual laboratory life, the modes of scientific communication and so on). Such \u2018objective\u2019 descriptions do have a subjective-social dimension, but this dimension is hidden within the social practices of science. The ostensive, direct reference is to the \u2018objective\u2019, the \u2018outside\u2019, the content of current science that we have today concerning various natural phenomena, such as physics and biology. Now, recent history and philosophy of science often suggests that this apparent objectivity cannot be characterized as dealing with things-out-there, as independent of mental contents-in-here. Science is permeated by the procedural and social regulations that go under the name of scientific method, that permits the constitution of a corpus of shared knowledge about natural objects. The linchpin of this constitution is public verification and validation according to complex human exchanges. What we take to be objective is what can be turned from individual accounts into a body of regulated knowledge. This body of knowledge is inescapably in part subjective, since it depends on individual observation and experience, and partly objective, since it is constrained and regulated by the empirical, natural phenomena. This brief reminder that the subjective is already implicit in the objective highlights how the received distinction between objective and subjective as an absolute", "label": 0}

This, in particular, pulls our research toward the refinement of episodes to incorporate quantitative temporal information, able to describe the time intervals observed for the {\\em is-followed-by} relation. \n \nWe proposed a refinement of episodes called {\\em quantitative episodes}, that provides quantitative temporal information in a readable, tree-based graphically representable form. These quantitative episodes describe the main groups of homogeneous behaviors within the occurrences of each episode, according to the elapsed times between the consecutive event types of the episode. Moreover, they are not provided in an isolated way, but in trees giving a global view of how the occurrences of the corresponding episode differentiate in homogeneous groups along the elements of the pattern. From a computational point of view, the main interest of the quantitative episodes is that they can be mined in a sound and complete way without increasing the cost of extractions significantly when compared to extractions of episodes alone. This is achieved through an extraction algorithm that tightly integrates episode extraction with a computationally reasonable analysis of temporal quantitative information.", "label": 0}

Previous studies on the regulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) levels by psychotropic medications are limited in scope and the underlying mechanism(s) remain elusive. In this review, the latest findings on the effects of pharmacologically heterogeneous groups of psychotropic drugs on NGF contents in the brain regions involved in the modulation of emotions are summarized. Moreover, the therapeutic potentials of the endocannabinoid system which is linked to depression and/or antidepressant effects and appears to interact with neurotrophin signalling, are reviewed. New findings demonstrate that endocannabinoid system is involved in the mechanisms of action of certain psychotropic medications including neurokinin receptor antagonists and that these are mediated via the upregulation of brain regional levels of NGF. This provides a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to novel drug designs. Biomedical Reviews 2010; 21: 31-46.", "label": 0}

In particular, the Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning (ULMFiT) and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithms have proven to have an impressive performance on several English text classification tasks. In this paper, we aim at developing an algorithm for Spanish Sentiment Analysis of short texts that is comparable to the state-of-the-art. In order to do so, we have adapted the ULMFiT and BERT algorithms to this setting. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (InterTASS 2017 and InterTASS 2018) show how this simple transfer learning approach performs well when compared to fancy deep learning techniques.", "label": 0}
